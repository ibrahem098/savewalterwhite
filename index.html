    <p class="yp1">My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I<br/>
		found out he was going to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was going to happen<br/>
		soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was real.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I thought about a lot of stuff.<br/>
		Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I kind<br/>
		of took him for granted or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, our parents are<br/>
		just always there.&nbsp;&nbsp;You expect them to always be bugging you<br/>
		to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or<br/>
		try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one<br/>
		day.&nbsp;&nbsp;And make you get up early on the weekend to have<br/>
		"family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br/>
		crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't feel that way now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything's different since<br/>
		Dad got his diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I realized that one day in the<br/>
		near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.</p>
        
        <p class="yp2">Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that<br/>
		question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-<br/>
		sible. One day he won't be here to ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I feel lucky when I hear<br/>
		his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-<br/>
		ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.</p>

        </ul>
    
        <p class="w1">My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.<br/>
            I mean, super brainiac annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the most random stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like<br/>
            how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.<br/>
            And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it<br/>
            takes up about 9% more space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt<br/>
            into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level<br/>
            will go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He<br/>
            doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.<br/>
            I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is.&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to cook<br/>
            because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-<br/>
            cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he<br/>
            goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.<br/>
            He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.</p>
    
        <p class="wall">The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've always had to<br/>
            hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White's kid.<br/>
            (Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser<br/>
            shoes he always wears).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves.<br/>
            Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with teachers.<br/>
            The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he does,<br/>
            and when you don't try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That's<br/>
            how he is at home and at school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only just figured out what a good qual-<br/>
            ity	that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what<br/>
            made me brave, too when I was younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I wanted to be or not.<br/>
            Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but because of<br/>
            my dad being a teacher there I was different.&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize two things now.<br/>
            First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a done deal.<br/>
            And two, he's the right dad for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't do a lot of physical stuff be-<br/>
            cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad and it wouldn't be with a<br/>
            lot of other dads I've met.&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd be disappointed because they're into<br/>
            sports or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, my dad doesn't have a disability but you sure<br/>
            wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get along. It<br/>
            makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't care<br/>
            about what the kids at school say anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is he's a good<br/>
            teacher and no one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know he<br/>
            cares.&nbsp;&nbsp;After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves the <br/>
            best.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to do<br/>
            for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, for his students, and for me and my family.</p>
            
        <p class="wall">It's been a really tough time in our family since my dad got cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not<br/>
            that there's ever a good time for something as awful and as scary as that,<br/>
            but it was sure a bad time for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom was pregnant with what she calls<br/>
            a surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though she's a newborn baby she's<br/>
            actually cute) and my dad had an extra job after school to try to help pay<br/>
            all the regular bills. And that was before he got his diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't<br/>
            have a lot of money but we were doing okay until all the medical bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;And<br/>
            my dad is pretty proud - okay, really proud - and doesn't want to take char-<br/>
            ity.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I'm doing this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not because I want to make him mad or<br/>
            upset, but because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.</p>
    
        <p class="wall">One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more than a<br/>
            regular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the best ones) don't<br/>
            take insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that's wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, one of the big reasons why<br/>
            my dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the first place was because he<br/>
            didn't want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That's the thing about my<br/>
            dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we want him<br/>
            around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long as<br/>
            possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we<br/>
            can't afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have with<br/>
            him. And I don't want to tell my little sister about my dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want her to<br/>
            know him for herself.</p>
